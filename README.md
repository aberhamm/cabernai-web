## ðŸ“¦ What's inside?

#### Apps

- `apps/ui` - UI web app based on [NextJS 14](https://nextjs.org/docs/14/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) ([Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)) - [README.md](./apps/ui/README.md)
- `apps/strapi` - [Strapi v5](https://strapi.io/) API with prepared page-builder components - [README.md](./apps/strapi/README.md)

#### Packages

- `packages/eslint-config`: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) configurations for client side applications
- `packages/prettier-config`: [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) configuration with import sort plugin and tailwind plugin included
- `packages/typescript-config`: tsconfig JSONs used throughout the monorepo (not used in "strapi" app for now)

## ðŸš€ Setup and usage

#### Transform this template to a project

- Based on this repository create/init new repository with project name. If the new repo is on Github, it is possible to use the GH function to "init new project from template". It keeps the commit history. Otherwise, it is necessary to clone main branch of this repo locally, copy all files to the new repository and commit them as an initial commit.
- In root `package.json` change `name` and `description` according to new project name. Optionally change names in apps and packages too. Keep `@repo` prefix if you don't prefer different scope/company.
- Modify `README.md` files of apps to be less general (eg. update projects names, customize tech stack). Project-specific READMEs should not contain general leftovers from the template.
- Follow "How to use this project template?" section in `apps/` READMEs to set up each app.
- See [README-DEPLOYMENT.md](README-DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete DigitalOcean deployment guide.
- If not using Heroku legacy support, remove `Procfile`(s) from repository.

_[After this preparation is done, delete this section from README]_

### VSCode Extensions

Install extensions listed in the [.vscode/extensions.json](.vscode/extensions.json) file and have a better development experience.

### Prerequisites

- node 20
- yarn 1.22
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (optional, recommended)

### Installation

```bash
# in root
(nvm use) # switch to correct nodejs version (v20)

# install deps for apps and packages that are part of this monorepo
yarn

# Ignore warning "Workspaces can only be enabled in private projects."
# https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/8580
```

### Environment Setup

**ðŸŽ¯ Unified Environment Approach:** Both development and production use the same root `.env` file!

```bash
# Quick setup for development
bash ./scripts/utils/fix-dev-issues.sh

# Or manually create .env file
# (If .env.example exists, copy it. Otherwise, the script will create a minimal one)
cp .env.example .env  # if .env.example exists

# Edit .env with your values
# For development: Leave DOMAIN_NAME empty (uses localhost)
# For production: Set DOMAIN_NAME to your domain
```

**Benefits:**

- âœ… **Same file structure** for development and production
- âœ… **No app-specific .env files** needed
- âœ… **Consistent environment** across all deployment types
- âœ… **Single source of truth** for all configuration

### Run - Development Options

After installing dependencies and setting up environment (previous step), you can run the project in multiple ways:

**ðŸŽ¯ Unified Development (Recommended):**

```bash
# Uses unified root .env file with Docker (consistent with production)
yarn dev:unified
```

**Traditional Development:**

```bash
# Run all apps in dev mode (requires app-specific .env files - DEPRECATED)
yarn dev

# Build all apps
yarn build

# Dev run of specific app(s)
yarn dev:ui
yarn dev:strapi
```

**ðŸŽ¯ Unified approach benefits:**

- âœ… **Same environment setup** as production
- âœ… **Single .env file** for all services
- âœ… **Docker consistency** across environments
- âœ… **No app-specific configuration** needed

## ðŸ”± Husky tasks

Husky is installed by default and configured to run following tasks:

1. `lint` (eslint) and `format` (prettier) on every commit (`pre-commit` hook). To do that, [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged) library is used. This is a fast failsafe to ensure code doesn't get committed if it fails linting rules and that when it does get committed, it is consistently formatted. Running linters only on staged files (those that have been added to Git index using `git add`) is much faster than processing all files in the working directory. The `format` task is configured in root `.lintstagedrc.js` and run globally for whole monorepo. The `lint` task is configured in each app individually and Strapi is skipped by default.

2. `commitlint` on every commit message (`commit-msg` hook). It checks if commit messages meet [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Development Issues

**ðŸ”§ Quick Fix (Recommended):**

```bash
# Interactive troubleshooting script
bash ./scripts/utils/fix-dev-issues.sh
```

**Manual Fixes:**

**Permission Errors in Strapi Build:**

```bash
# Fix file ownership issues (common after Docker usage)
sudo chown -R $USER:staff apps/strapi/dist/
sudo chown -R $USER:staff apps/strapi/.strapi/
```

**Environment Variables Not Loading:**

```bash
# Ensure .env file exists in root
ls -la .env

# Check symlinks for app compatibility (created automatically)
ls -la apps/strapi/.env apps/ui/.env.local
```

**Node Modules Issues:**

```bash
# Clean everything and reinstall
bash ./scripts/utils/rm-all.sh
yarn install
```

**Sharp Module Errors (macOS ARM64):**

```bash
# Reinstall Sharp with correct binaries
cd apps/ui && yarn add sharp --ignore-engines
```

**Sentry DSN Warnings:**

```bash
# If you see "Invalid Sentry Dsn" warnings in development
# Either set a valid Sentry DSN in your .env file:
SENTRY_DSN=https://your-sentry-dsn@sentry.io/project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=https://your-sentry-dsn@sentry.io/project-id

# Or leave empty to disable Sentry:
SENTRY_DSN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=
```

### Production Deployment Issues

**GitHub Actions Failing:**

```bash
# Run automated troubleshooting script on your server
sudo ./scripts/deploy/fix-github-actions.sh
```

**Environment Variable Issues:**

- Ensure `DOMAIN_NAME` is set in GitHub Repository Variables
- Use `./scripts/deploy/env-generator.sh` to create production `.env`
- Check [README-DEPLOYMENT.md](README-DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete setup guide

## ðŸ“¿ Scripts

### Package.json

- `yarn commit` - interactive commit message generator ðŸ”¥. How? Stage files you want to commit (e.g. using VS Code Source Control) and then run this script in the terminal from root and fill in the required information.
- `yarn format` - format code using prettier in whole monorepo. Prettier formats `package.json` files too.

### Utils

- `bash ./scripts/utils/rm-modules.sh` - Remove all `node_modules` folders in the monorepo. Useful for scratch dependencies installation.
- `bash ./scripts/utils/rm-all.sh` - Remove all `node_modules`, `.next`, `.turbo`, `.strapi`, `dist` folders.
- `bash ./scripts/utils/fix-dev-issues.sh` - **Interactive development troubleshooting script** to fix common local development issues.

### Heroku

- `./scripts/heroku/heroku-postbuild.sh` - Script for Heroku deployment to decide which app to build. It can be removed if not deploying to Heroku.

### Deployment

- `./scripts/deploy/` - **DigitalOcean deployment scripts** for automated production deployment. See [README-DEPLOYMENT.md](README-DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete guide.
- `./scripts/deploy/fix-github-actions.sh` - **Troubleshooting script** to fix common GitHub Actions deployment issues.

## ðŸ’™ Feedback

This repo was created based on [@dev-templates-public](https://github.com/notum-cz/dev-templates-public). If you encounter a problem with the template code during development, or something has changed/is being done differently in the meantime, or you have implemented a useful feature that should be part of that template, please create an issue with a description or PR in that repository. So we can keep those templates updated and great features. Thanks.
